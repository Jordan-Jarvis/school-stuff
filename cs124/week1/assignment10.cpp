* Program:
*    Assignment 10, Hello World          (e.g. Assignment 10, Hello World)
*    Sister Hansen, CS124
* Author:
*    Jordan Jarvis
* Summary: 
*    This is my Hello World source code.
*
*    Estimated:  0.5 hrs   
*    Actual:     1.0 hrs
*      The most difficult part was the fact that I could not find
*      the info i needed in the book.
*      It took longer than i would have expected to find 
*      the right section. I also really don't like emacs.
*      it is a pain. Also,
*      the style checker is a real pain.
*      I feel like there is some requirements here that are not needed,
*      that make this harder than it needs to be. I code powershell and batch
*      for work. and never have i worked this long to
*      write such a simple program. 
*      I would get fired if i did.
*      It isn't code that takes forever or even the stuff i am typing now.
*      it is the format checker.
